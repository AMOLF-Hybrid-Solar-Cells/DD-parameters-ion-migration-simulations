# DD-parameters-ion-migration-simulations
"Simulation data.zip" contains the parameter set used for the drift diffusion simulations in Figures 1 and 3 of "Ion Migration in Perovskite Solar Cells" by Jarla Thiesbrummel et al.
The simulations were performed using Simsalabim (http://simsalabim-online.com) with the parameter files found in the different folders in the repository. The figures were produced using Wolfram 14.1 for Mac using the file "plotting.nb".
